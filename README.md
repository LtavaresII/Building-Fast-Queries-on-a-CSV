# Building-Fast-Queries-on-a-CSV
The goal of this guided project is to create a class that represents a inventory of an online laptop store and want to build a way to answer a few different business questions about our inventory. The methods in that class will implement the queries that we want to answer about our inventory. We will also preprocess that data to make those queries run faster.
